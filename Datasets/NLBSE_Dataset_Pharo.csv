BlLayout,phases are modeled as subclasses of class blspaceframephase and are executed once per frame.,[1 0 0 0 0 0 0],original

BlLayout,"this is done after events and tasks have been executed, but before the drawing phase.",[1 0 0 0 0 0 0],original
BlLayout,"layouting should to be executed during a frame when various properties like, width, height or position change in any element contained by the space.",[1 0 0 0 0 0 0],original
BlLayout,"however, an important aspect in bloc, is that when one of these properties changes, layouting is not performed immediately.",[1 0 0 0 0 0 0],original

BlLayout,performing the layout on an element consists in executing three main steps,[1 0 0 0 0 0 0],original
BlLayout,measuring bounds,[1 0 0 0 0 0 0],original
BlLayout,this is the first step when performing a layout on an element and consists in determening the measured bounds of that element.,[1 0 0 0 0 0 0],original
BlLayout,each element can decide how it wants to be measured method blelement #onmeasure .,[1 0 0 0 0 0 0],original
BlLayout,by default class blelement delegates the measuring to its layout.,[1 0 0 0 0 0 0],original
BlLayout,layouts should override method bllayout #measure with to implement the actual measuring.,[1 0 0 0 0 0 0],original
BlLayout,normally layouts follow a top to bottom approach they measure the current element and then asks its children to do the measuring.,[1 0 0 0 0 0 0],original
BlLayout,each element has real bounds blelement #bounds and measured bounds blelement #measuredbounds .,[1 0 0 0 0 0 0],original
BlLayout,the real bounds contain the actual position and extent of an element that users of that element should rely on.,[1 0 0 0 0 0 0],original
BlLayout,the measured bounds are used during layouting to hold the new extent of an element.,[1 0 0 0 0 0 0],original
BlLayout,the measuring phase changes only the extent in the measured bounds.,[1 0 0 0 0 0 0],original
BlLayout,after the entire layout phase is completed the real bounds and measured bounds will have the same value.,[1 0 0 0 0 0 0],original
BlLayout,the measured bounds act like a temporary cache for the new bounds of an element.,[1 0 0 0 0 0 0],original
